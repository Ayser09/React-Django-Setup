# React-Django-Setup
Integrated Django with React, introducing an input number button. Upon selecting 1 or 2, it indicates "Available"; otherwise, it states "Unavailable." For blank submissions, a "No data available" message is displayed, enhancing user experience.
I successfully integrated Django with React, creating a seamless user experience. One of the key features I implemented was an input number button. When users interact with this button and change its value to 1 or 2, it triggers an immediate response that displays "Available." However, if the input doesn't match these values, it shows "Unavailable." Additionally, when the submit button is clicked without any input, the system displays a message indicating "No data available." This dynamic and user-friendly integration ensures smooth interactions and clear feedback, enhancing the overall usability of the application.
